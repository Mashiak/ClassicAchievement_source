Bring back the old-school achievement UI. Based on the 1.11.2 source code. I have restored the features of the old version as much as possible.

However, advancement is quite different from achievements, so I made some adjustments (mainly regarding the logic for spreading achievement nodes).

It comes with the achievements 'Taking Inventory,' 'Getting Wood,' and 'Benchmaking,' and changes the 'Advancement' text to 'Achievement'
